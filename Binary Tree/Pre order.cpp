/*You are given the root node of a binary tree.Print its preorder traversal.

Input Format:
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

Output Format:
The only line of output prints the preorder traversal of the given binary tree.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
1 2 4 5 3 6 7

Sample Input 2:
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1

 Sample Output 1:
5 6 2 3 9 10*/
